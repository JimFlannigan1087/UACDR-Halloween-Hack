# UACDR-Halloween-Hack
Tings. This is the Halloween version of my glorious UACDR WAD. Ye can doth expect spooks and scares of great caliber, as well as a legion of terrifying demons guarding the secrets of Castle Jimsex. 

To play this WAD, simply download this entire repository as a ZIP and change the downloaded file's extension to .pk3 (e.g. UACDR Halloween.pk3) 

I recommend you play with the built-in playerclass and learn how thy Persona works for the best experience. Also you have to turn off render culling to make the cracktro work right in LZDoom. Anyway, Jim Flannigan over and out!

Any assets that I didn't make are from Realm667 or UACMN or whatever. Credits are in credits.txt
Persona 5 HUD came from TrashRaccoonSnuffy
