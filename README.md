# UACDR-Halloween-Hack
Tings. This is the Halloween version of my glorious UACDR WAD. Ye can doth expect spooks and scares of great caliber, as well as a legion defending the castle of yours truly. I recommend you play with the built-in playerclass and learn how thy Persona works for the best experience. Anyway, Jim Flannigan over and out!
