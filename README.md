# UACDR-Halloween-Hack
Tings. This is the Halloween version of my glorious UACDR WAD. Ye can doth expect spooks and scares of great caliber, as well as a legion of terrifying demons guarding the secrets of Castle Jimsex. 

To play this WAD, simply download this entire repository as a ZIP and change the downloaded file's extension to .pk3 (e.g. UACDR Halloween.pk3) 

I recommend you play with the built-in playerclass and learn how thy Persona works for the best experience.
For LZDoom users, you'll need to turn off Wall render culling for the cracktro to work right, and probably play with the Sprite render culling for the snow spawners on map09.
Anyway, Jim Flannigan over and out!

Any assets that I didn't make are from Realm667 or UACMN or whatever. Credits are in credits.txt

Persona 5 HUD came from TrashRaccoonSnuffy
