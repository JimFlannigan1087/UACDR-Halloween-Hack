# UACDR-Halloween-Hack
Tings. This is the Halloween version of my glorious UACDR WAD. Ye can doth expect spooks and scares of great caliber, as well as a legion defending the castle of yours truly. I recommend you play with the built-in playerclass and learn how thy Persona works for the best experience. Also you have to turn off render culling to make the cracktro work right in LZDoom. Anyway, Jim Flannigan over and out!
